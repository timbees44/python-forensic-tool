# python-forensic-tool
Very basic python script for getting hidden strings from various file types.

Haven't figured out how to get it to save output yet. Temporary solution is to run "script" in linux terminal.
for example:
  script output.txt

This will then save all terminal outputs to the designated file.
Run "exit" in terminal after executing for_script.py to exit script and stop capturing terminal output.
